###Using the new logging system
A basic demo developed by Keith is available in the DemoLauncher class.  Search through it for the word "TUTORIAL" for examples of how to use the system.
This system has also been integrated into the existing city demo.

This code contains an AlertLog that can be used to log messages with different Levels and Tags (represented in the AlertTag enum).
